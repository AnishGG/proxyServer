Proxy Server

Usage:
python server.py
python proxy.py

This sets up the server and the proxy server running.

Requests can be sent from the client side from browser or via a curl request

If the request is sent via the browser then proxy settings for the browser need to be updated to localhost and port
number: 12345

Generally, when the client (browser or curl command) makes a request, the request is sent to
the web server. The web server then processes the request and sends back a response
message to the requesting client.

In order to improve the performance we create a proxy server between the client and the webserver. 
A web proxy is a program that acts as an intermediary between a web client (browser or curl) and a web server.

The client requests the objects via the proxy server. The proxy server will forward the clientâ€™s request to the web server. 
The web server will then generate a response message and deliver it to the proxy server, which in turn sends it to the client.

Rquest via curl request:
curl -x http://localhost:12345 http://127.0.0.1:20000/1.txt


Features:
Caching: THe proxy server has a caching capacity of 3. When a requested file is present in the cache then a conditional
request is sent to the server where If-Modified-Since header is added with the time when the file was stored in the
proxy server. If the time is less than the time the file modified in the main server, the server responds with 200
message where the entire file will be sent by the server to the proxy server which in turn will send it to the client.
If otherwise, 304 request will be sent from the server and the file cached in the proxy server will be sent to the
client.
NOTE: Caching will not happen if the server response had Cache-Control header with no-cache.

If file is not found then 404 file not found will be sent

All error scenarios are handled.

Multiple clients can send requests at once via the proxy server as the client requests are handled through threads.
